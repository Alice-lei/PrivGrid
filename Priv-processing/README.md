# Priv-processing

## Function

This project implements a privacy-preserving short-term personal load forecasting service in the smart grid, i.e., predicting the future electricity consumption of customers based on the input data of their electricity consumption at a series of time points.

In this project, the training has both forward and backward propagation processes, while the forcasting is only the forward propagation process.

## Compile

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake make git libgmp-dev -y
```

Clone source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alice-lei/PrivGrid.git
cd PrivGrid/Priv-processing
```

Compile:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

You can find the executable file in the `bin` directory.

## Usage

First create `input/triples` and `input/data` directories in the same directory as the `Priv-processing` executable, then place the multiplication triples generated by the `AMT-via-SIP` project in the `input/triples` directory, and the secret shares generated by the `Share-gen` project in the `input/data` directory. Finally, run `Priv-processing -r ${ROLE}` to start the training and the forcast.

```
